# Never-Ending-Grocery-List-App

A simple web app for keeping track of items needed from the grocery store. The initial version of this web app was done as a front-end web development  assignment for Thinkful.com. 

## The Name & Concept

The concept behind the app is that in real life you often need different items from different places (e.g., big box discount stores, grocery stores, specialty food stores, etc.), so by the time you cross some items off your list at one store, new items are often already being added. Since such lists seem continuous, the app was titled the "Never-Ending Grocery List". The design of the app is, therefore, focused on a simple interface that allows users to add and remove items but assumes that users rarely, if ever, remove all the items on the list at once.

## Features 

With the above simple concept in mind, the app includes:

1. an input box for needed items to be added.
  - when duplicate items are entered items stack (increase quantity on existing item).
2. a "need" list for items yet to be purchased. 
  - total items displayed at top of grouping.
  - when an item is purchased it can be checked (moving it to the "got" list).
  - when an error is made or an item is otherwise not needed it can be removed with delete button.
3. a "got" list for items already purchased.
  - total items displayed at top of grouping.
  - when user wants to move an item back to "need" list, it can be unchecked. 
  - when history of "got" items is no longer wanted, the clear list button can be used.
  - when a user wants to remove select items from the "got" list, the delete button can be used.
