# Never-Ending-Grocery-List-App

A simple web app for keeping track of items needed from the grocery store. The initial version of this web app was done as a front-end web development  assignment for Thinkful.com. 

## The Name & Concept

The concept behind the app is that in real life you often need different items from different places (e.g., big box discount stores, grocery stores, specialty food stores, etc.), so by the time you cross some items off your list at one store, new items are often already being added.
